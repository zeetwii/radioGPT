Soldier 1: This is Alpha Team, do you copy? Over.

Soldier 2: Copy that, Alpha Team. This is Bravo Team. We copy. Over.

Soldier 3: This is Charlie Team. We're on standby and ready to move. Over.

Soldier 1: Bravo, Charlie, we have visual on Godzilla's location. It's massive. I repeat, massive. We need to coordinate our attack. Over.

Soldier 2: Understood, Alpha. We're approaching your position. We'll provide support from the east. Charlie, hold the west flank. Over.

Soldier 3: Roger that, Bravo. We'll hold our ground and provide cover fire. Let's take down this monster. Out.

[The soldiers maneuver into position, their weapons at the ready.]

Soldier 1: Alpha, this is Bravo. We're in position. Waiting for your signal. Over.

Soldier 2: Copy, Bravo. Standby. Charlie, do you have eyes on Godzilla? Over.

Soldier 3: Negative, Bravo. We're still trying to establish visual contact. Standby. Over.

[An ear-piercing roar echoes through the battlefield as Godzilla comes into view.]

Soldier 1: Bravo, Charlie, engage now! Open fire! Over.

Soldier 2: Firing at will! Rockets away! Over.

Soldier 3: Charlie engaging! Grenades deployed! Over.

[Explosions rock the ground as the soldiers pour firepower into Godzilla.]

Soldier 1: It's not slowing down! Keep firing! Alpha, we need heavy artillery support! Over.

Soldier 2: Alpha, this is Bravo. Heavy artillery is en route. Hold tight! Over.

Soldier 3: Charlie Team, we're taking heavy casualties! We need backup! Over.

Soldier 1: Bravo, Charlie, hold on! Reinforcements are on the way! Over.

[The soldiers continue their relentless assault, but their efforts seem futile.]

Soldier 2: Alpha, this is Bravo. Our rockets are ineffective. We're running low on ammo. Over.

Soldier 3: Charlie Team, we can't hold any longer! We're being overrun! Over.

Soldier 1: Hold on, everyone! We're not giving up! Bravo, Charlie, fall back to our position. We'll regroup and reassess. Over.

[The soldiers retreat, their morale shaken by the unstoppable force of Godzilla.]

Soldier 2: Alpha, this is Bravo. We're retreating, but it's gaining on us. Over.

Soldier 3: Charlie Team, we're in retreat, but we won't make it! Over.

Soldier 1: Stay together! We'll find another way out. We can't leave anyone behind! Over.

[The sounds of destruction and chaos intensify as Godzilla rampages closer.]

Soldier 2: Alpha, Bravo here. We're trapped! There's nowhere left to run! Over.

Soldier 3: Charlie Team, we're surrounded! It's over! Over.

Soldier 1: I... I'm sorry, everyone. We did our best. We fought with valor. It's been an honor serving with you all. Over and out.

[Silence falls as the soldiers face their final moments, overwhelmed by the destructive power of Godzilla.]
