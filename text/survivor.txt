Survivor: This is... this is Survivor 17. Can anyone hear me? Please respond. Over.

Radio Silence.

Survivor: This is Survivor 17, broadcasting on all frequencies. If anyone's out there, please respond. I'm seeking other survivors. Over.

Radio Silence.

Survivor: This... this is getting desperate. I know I can't be the only one left. If you can hear me, if anyone can hear me, please... please respond. Over.

Radio Silence.

Survivor: I... I can't give up hope. I won't. There have to be others out there. If you're listening, know that you're not alone. I'm searching for you. We can band together, fight these things together. Over.

Radio Silence.

Survivor: It's been days... weeks, maybe. The cities are overrun, streets filled with those... those things. But I can't lose faith. There have to be pockets of humanity still fighting, still surviving. Please, if you're out there, reach out to me. Over.

Radio Silence.

Survivor: The world has changed. It's a nightmare out there, but I refuse to believe it's the end. We're resilient, we're survivors. Together, we can rebuild, start anew. Please... someone, respond. Over.

Radio Silence.

Survivor: Maybe... maybe there's no one left. Maybe I'm the last one. But I won't stop searching. I'll keep moving, keep fighting. If there's a chance, however small, that someone's still out there, I'll find them. This is Survivor 17, signing off. Over and out.

[The radio falls silent, echoing the desolate world after the zombie apocalypse.]
